Online food ordering app

Order food from the newest place in town.  User can create an account to order various foods for pick up.


__Build__
Built with ruby on sinatra with some Jquery thrown in.  Styled using Less complied by GULP. Uses ActiveRecord ORM


__Approach__
Created the tables and their relations first to understand the process I wanted take.  Then made the wireframe with pen and paper and later transferred to digital.  From there I made the folder layout and went from there.

_Unsolved Issues_
the final reciept erb.

_Future_
I want to solve the recipt problem and be able to send a text to bar to show ticket for food using Twillo service.

Add facebook login and paypal API


_User Story_
As a user I want to easliy loging and see the menu.  I want to easily see what items I have selected and then checkout.

As a bar owner I want to be able to see orders
